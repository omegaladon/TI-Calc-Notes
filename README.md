# TI-Calc-Notes
Notes to put on your TI calculator for school classes.

## How to use
Download the .8xp file and send it to your calculator using TI Connect CE.
To view the file, install the stuff in the `install` folder. Use the `CabriJr` app to execute `arTIfiCE` and then `ASMHOOK`. Then, use the `NOTES` program under `prgm` to view the notes.

Fake memory clear is a program that will make it look like you cleared your memory, but it will actually just show a message. This is useful for when you don't want to show your notes to a teacher.

## Make your own
Make your own notes by dragging any text file onto the `ConvText.exe` file. This will create a .8xp file that you can send to your calculator.
