strong acids:
HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, H2SO4, HClO4
conjugate base of strong acid = weak

weak: equilibirum
strong: no equilibrium

compare ka and kb, which is larger?
ka > kb: acidic
ka < kb: basic

equivalence point: moles acid = moles base
endpoint: indicator changes color
half equivalence point: ph = pKa

pKa indicator is when the color changes

buffer: resists ph change
acid reacts with conjugate base, base reacts with conjugate acid
pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
