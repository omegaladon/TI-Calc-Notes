ionic: metal/nonmetal
- high melting point, brittle, conductive
covalent: nm/nm
- low melting point, nonconductive
- polar: unequal sharing of electrons (distance from each other pn table)
- nonpolar: equal sharing of electrons

substitutional alloy:
- metal substitute into another metal's lattice
interstitial alloy:
- small atoms fill in spaces between larger atoms

formal charge: # valence - # lone electrons - # bonds (double = 2, triple = 3)
- formal charge of 0 is most stable

ldf: more e = more polarizable = stronger ldf
dd: polar molecules
h: O-H, N-H, F-H
- h contains dd and ldf
