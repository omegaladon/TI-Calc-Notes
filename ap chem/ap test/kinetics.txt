potential energy curves:
before the hump, energy = E of reactants
after the hump, energy = E of products
hump = activation energy (Ea)

arrhenius equation: High temp & low Ea = faster rxn

Rate = <>[] / <>t
Rate = k[A]^m
- m = order of reaction
- k = rate constant (can't be negative)

[B] and rate increase 4x
  Rate = k[A]^m
  4 = [4]^m
  m = 1, so rxn is first order IN B

Rate of rxn = k[A]^m[B]^n
  m & n = order of reaction in A and B
Overall order of reaction = m + n

graphing:
0 order, [A] vs t = linear
  [A] = -kt + [A]0
1st order, ln[A] vs t = linear
  ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]0
2nd order, 1/[A] vs t = linear
  1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]0

rxns occur in series of steps, some not involving elements
overall series of steps = mechanism

rate limiting step = slowest step in mechanism
rate law is based on stoich of rls

mechanism validity:
1. elementary steps sum to overall balanced rxn
2. rate law reflects stoich of rls
