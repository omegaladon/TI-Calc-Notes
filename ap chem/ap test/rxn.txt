a/b: transfer of H+ ion
redox: oxidation and reduction
- oxidation states:
  - O in compound, -2 (O in peroxide is -1)
  - H = +1 when bonded to nonmetals, -1 when bonded to metals
  - in compound, alkali metals = +1, alkaline earth metals = +2
2 replacement: 2 elements in compound switch places
1 replacement: element replaces another in compound
combustion: reaction with O2 to produce CO2 and H2O
decomposition: compound breaks down into 2 or more simpler substances
synthesis: 2 or more substances combine to form a new compound
