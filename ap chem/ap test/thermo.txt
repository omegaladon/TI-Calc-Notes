forming bond releases energy
breaking bond requires energy

-Q (warmer object) = +Q (cooler object)

<>H = Heat of reaction
- negative = exothermic, positive = endothermic
- <>H = <>H products - <>H reactants
- <>H = sum(H bonds broken) - sum(H bonds formed)
- <>H = <>Hf products - <>Hf reactants
Hf = enthalpy of formation, standard state = 0

<>s = entropy, disorder in system
- negative = less disorder, positive = more disorder
- <>s = <>s products - <>s reactants

<>G = Gibbs free energy, spontaneity
- negative = spontaneous, positive = nonspontaneous
- <>G = <>H - T<>S

Hess's Law:
- when flip reaction, flip sign of <>H
- when multiply reaction, multiply <>H by that number
- add reactions together, add <>H together
