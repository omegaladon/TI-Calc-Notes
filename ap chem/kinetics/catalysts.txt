potential energy curves:
before the hump, energy = E of reactants
after the hump, energy = E of products
hump = activation energy (Ea)

top of curve = "activated complex"

catalysts speed up rxn by providing alternate pathway with lower Ea
catalysts do not change the overall energy of the rxn

enzymes: biological catalysts

arrhenius equation:
High temp & low Ea = faster rxn

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)
- RT = average kinetic energy
- the larger the Ea/RT, the slower the rxn
