e = 1.602x10^-19 C
larger charges = multiple of e

conductors: charge uniformly distrubted on surface
insulators: charge uniformly distrubted throughout

induction: process of charging a conductor by bringing it near a charged object and grounding it
ex, negative rod next to neutral conductor, electrons away from rod, leaving positive charges on other side
    if grounded, electrons flow to ground, leaving positive charges on conductor

Coulomb's Law: F = k|q1q2|/r^2
Electric Field: E = kq(rhat)/r^2
Electric Potential Energy: U = kq1q2/r
Electric Potential: V = kq/r
