dEx = 1/4PIe * dq/r^2 * cos(O)
dEx = 1/4PIe * dq/(x^2 + a^2) * x/sqrt(x^2 + a^2)
dEx = 1/4PIe * xdq/(x^2 + a^2)^3/2
integrate
E = Qx/4PIe(x^2 + a^2)^3/2

limit a -> 0 (E) = Q/4PIex^3

where
a is the radius of the base of the cone
x is the point of interest to the base of the cone
r is the hypotenuse of a and x
