Electric Field of an Electric Dipole @ point
E = 1/4PIe * qd/((d/2)^2+y^2)^3/2
where
d is the distance between the charges

at a large distance from dipole, y >> d
E = 1/4PIe * qd/y^3

The EF of a point charge falls off as 1/r^2, while the Electric field of a dipole falls off as 1/r^3

Torque
T = pEsinÎ¸
where p is the dipole moment (qd)
T = 0 when parallel to the electric field
T = max when perpendicular to the electric field

Work on a dipole
dW = TdO
dW = pEsin(O)dO
W = -pEcos(O) = U
