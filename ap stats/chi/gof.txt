Compares observed vs expected frequencies for single variable

H is generally:
H0: stated distribution is correct
Ha: stated distribution is not correct

conditions:
1. random
2. independent (10%)
3. all expected counts > 5 (must check all variables in the category)

ec = np_i where p_i is the proportion for category i specified in the null hypothesis
df = num of vars in category - 1

x^2 = sum of (observed - expected)^2 / expected
x^2cdf(x^2, df) = p value
^^ 2nd vars > x^2cdf
^^ write all parameters to calc command for credit

name: x^2 test for goodness of fit

calc:
x^2GOF-Test: Stat > Tests > x^2GOF-Test
x^2GOF-Test gives x^2 = [], p-value = [], with df = [].

interpret p value:
Assuming that the claimed distribution of [] is correct, there is a [p-value] probability of getting a x^2 statistic of [x^2 value] or greater by chance alone.
