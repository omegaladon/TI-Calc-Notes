pop: u_y = a + Bx (greek)
sam: y^ = a + bx

dist of b (sample slope)
center: u_b = B
spread: o_s = o / o_x sqrt(n)
shape: normal, look at residuals

conditions: LINEAR
1. linear, residual plot must show no curved pattern
2. independent
3. normal, dotplot of residuals cant show skewness or outliers
4. equal std, std y = std x, check residuals to ensure equal scatter around y = 0 for all x
5. random
