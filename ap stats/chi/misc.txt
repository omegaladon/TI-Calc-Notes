Goodness of fit: 1 variable in 1 population
Homogeneity: 1 variable in 2 or more populations
Independence: 2 or more variables in 1 population

x^2 distribution:
only positive values
right skewed
as df increases, the distribution approaches normal
p = area to the right of the x^2 value

minitab:
Observed = first number
Expected = second number
x^2 contribution = third number
x^2, df, p-value at bottom

computer software reports p-value for two sided test, so divide by 2 for one sided test
