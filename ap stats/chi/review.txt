regression analysis table:
Constant - coef = a
[context] - coef = b
[context] - SE Coef = SE_b
std = S

interpret a (y int):
We predict a [context y] score of [a] when the [context x] is 0.

interpret B (slope):
For every 1 unit increase in [context x], we predict a [context y] score increase of [b].

interpret o (std deviation):
THe mean [context y] varies by an average of [o] from the [context y] predicted by the LSRL using x = [context x].

interpret SE_b (standard error of the slope):
If we repeated the random sampling many times, the slope of hte samples regression line would vary by an average of [SE_b] from the true population slope for predicting [context y] from [context x].
