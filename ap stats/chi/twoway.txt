Homogeneity:
compares dist of a SINGLE categorical variable across SEVERAL populations

H is generally:
H0: no difference in dist of variable across populations
Ha: there is a difference in dist of variable across populations

EC = (row total * column total) / table total
df = (rows - 1) * (columns - 1)

conditions:
Independent & random
10%: sample size < 10% of population
normal: all expected counts > 5

calc:
make matrix: 2nd > x^-1 (matrix) > edit > enter data
x^2-Test: Stat > Tests > x^2-Test
x^2-Test gives x^2 = [], p-value = [], with df = [].

interpret p value:
Assuming [H0 in context] is true, there is a [p-value] probability of getting a x^2 test statistic of [x^2] or greater by chance alone.
