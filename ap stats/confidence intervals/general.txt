CI = PE +- MOE

as n up, MOE down (more precise)
as n up, variability down
as CL up, MOE up (less precise)
as MOE up, CI up

conditions for making CI about a proportion:
random - must be random sample (srs, established polling org, Gallup poll, etc.)
10% - when sampling w/o replacement, n < 0.10N
large counts - BOTH np >= 10 & n(1-p) >= 10
constructing:
p +- z * standard error

confidence level of x%:
area under normal curve is 100 - x%
ex, CL = 92%, z = invnorm(.04,0,1,left)=-1.751

PANIC!
state parameter of interest
check if conditions are satisfied
name the CI (1 sample z interval for p) or (2 sample z interval for p1-p2)
find CI
interpret

to find n that will give a C% CI with max MOE,
MOE >= z * std
use p = 0.5 to solve
