CL:
If we were to take many simple random samples of the same size from the same population, about C% of the resulting CIs would give the [parameter in context]
[parameter in context] = "true proportion of red beads in the container"
CI:
We are C% confident that the interval from 1 to 2 gives the true [parameter in context]
[parameter in context] = "proportion of red beads in the container"
Standard error (pop):
In repeated SRS of the same size, the sample proportion of [context] varies from the population proportion by about [value]

Is there convincing evidence?
There is convincing evidence that [parameter in context] because all the values in the CI are [less,greater] than [value in context]

Difference in p:
[same as CI]...gives the true difference in proportion of...[same as CI]
