PHANTOMS

P: parameter
we want u1 - u2 where...
u1&2 = the true mean number of [whatever]
ex: u1 = the true mean number of IQ score for all high school students who take AP statistics, u2 = do not take APS

h: hypothesis

a: assumptions
MUST BE INDEPENDENT *STATE
random
10%, n < .1N (not in experiment)
  check for both populations
normal,
  a. CLT (n > 30)
  b. pop is normal
  c. graph to assess normality, don't use t if strong skewness or outlies
  check for both populations

n: name of test
two sample t test for u1-u2

t&o: test statistic
Stat > Test > 2-SampTtest,
-- "2-sampTtest gives t = [], p-value = [], with df = []"

m&s: make a statement
"Since the p-value of [] is less than the significance level of [], we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in IQ scores between AP Stats students and non-AP stats students."
"Since the p-value of [] is greater than the significance level of [], we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in IQ scores between AP Stats students and non-AP stats students."
