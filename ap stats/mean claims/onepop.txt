PHANTOMS

P: parameter
u = the true mean number of [whatever]
ex: u = the true mean # of minutes of music played per hour by this station

h: hypothesis
H0: what the problem claims
ex: Station claims to play an average of 50 min of music per hour, so H0: u = 50
Ha: what you suspect
ex: You suspect that the station plays less than 50 min of music per hour, so Ha: u < 50

a: assumptions
random
10%, n < .1N (not in experiment)
normal,
  a. CLT (n > 30)
  b. pop is normal
  c. graph to assess normality, don't use t if strong skewness or outlies

n: name of test
one sample t test for u

t&o: test statistic
Stat > Test > T-Test,
-- "T-test gives t = [], p-value = [], with df = []"

m&s: make a statement
"Since the p-value of [] is less than the significance level of [], we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the station plays less than 50 min of music per hour."
"Since the p-value of [] is greater than the significance level of [], we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the station plays less than 50 min of music per hour."
