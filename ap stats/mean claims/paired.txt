PHANTOMS

P: parameter
udiff = the true mean difference ([] - []) in []
ex: udiff = the true mean difference (placebo - caffeine) in depression score

h: hypothesis

a: assumptions
random
10%, n < .1N (not in experiment)
  check for both populations
  if experiement, state random assignment
normal,
  a. CLT (n > 30)
  b. pop is normal
  c. graph to assess normality, don't use t if strong skewness or outlies
  check for both populations

n: name of test
one sample t test for u

t&o: test statistic
Stat > Test > T-Test,
-- "T-test gives t = [], p-value = [], with df = []"

m&s: make a statement
"Since the p-value of [] is less than the significance level of [], we reject the null hypothesis..."
"Since the p-value of [] is greater than the significance level of [], we fail to reject the null hypothesis..."
