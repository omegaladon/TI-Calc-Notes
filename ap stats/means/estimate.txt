PANIC!

P, parameters
ex: u = the true mean weight of an oreo cookie

a, assumptions (conditions)
random
10%, n < .1N (not in experiment)
normal,
  a. CLT (n > 30)
  b. pop is normal
  c. graph to assess normality, don't use t if strong skewness or outlies

n, name
ex: One sample t interval for u

i, interval
CI = x_bar +- t * s_x / sqrt(n)
state dof - (x, y) with df = n - 1
or
Stat > Tests > 8: TInterval
write, TInterval gives (x, y) with df = n - 1

c, conclusion
"We are [CL]% confident the interval from x to y contains the [parameter]"
ex: "We are 95% confident the interval from 13.5 to 14.5 contains the true mean weight of an oreo cookie"
