CI = x_bar +- t * s_x / sqrt(n)
t * s_x / sqrt(n) is moe

moe:
  decreases as n increases
  increases as CL increases
  does not account for bias

do not know sample n, use z instead of t
z * o / sqrt(n) <= moe
underestimates sample size, negligible for large samples

Given CL, z score is:
  invnorm(half of 1 - CL)
  half of 1 - CL
