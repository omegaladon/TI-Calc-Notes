Paired = two values of the same variable for each individual or pair of similar individuals
start by finding the diff beetween

parameter:
u_diff = true mean different (param1 - param2) [context]
"true mean different (new - standard) reading test score"

conditions:
  random
  10% (n_diff < .1N_diff)
  normal

name:
one sample t interval for u_diff 
OR 
paired t interval for u_diff

CI =
x_diff +- t * s_diff / sqrt(n_diff)
or
same as estimate
