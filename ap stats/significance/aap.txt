P-value = probability of getting convincing evidence for Ha as stronger than the observed evidence when H0 is true

Interpretation of p-value
Assuming the [H0 is true in context] tere is a [p-value] probability of getting a [sample data] or [more extreme in the specified direction of Ha].
Assuming the player does make 80% of his shots, there is a 0.0075 probability of making 32 out of 50 shots or less.

CL = 1 - alpha
find z(alpha/2) and use it to find the margin of error
MOE = z(alpha/2) * std
