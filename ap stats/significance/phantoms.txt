P = State parameter
... p = the true proportion of CA residents who stream shows and movies on Netflix
h = hypotheses
... H0 =, Ha = etc
a = assumptions (conditions)
... check lc, 10%, and random
n = name
... 1 sample z test for p or 2 sample z test for p1 - p2
t = test statistic (z-score)
... use z-score formula, z = (p-hat - p) / sqrt(p(1-p)/n)
o = obtain p-value
... use normalcdf with zscore, -1E99 or 1E99 depending on Ha
m = make a decision (reject or fail to reject H0)
... compare p-value to alpha, if p-value < alpha, reject H0
s = state a conclusion
... Since p-value > alpha, we fail to reject H0. There is not convincing evidence that there is an advantage to performing last.
