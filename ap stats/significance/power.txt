Power = probability to find convincing evidence for Ha when Ha is true
How likely the significance test to avoid a Type II error

Power = P(reject H0 | H1 is true)
Power = 1 - P(Type II error)

Interpretation =
If the true mean is really [mean], there is a [power] probabilty that the sample will provide convincing evidence [for Ha].

Power increases when
- Larger sample size
... why? because larger n gives more info about p
- Significance level a is Larger
... why? because larger a makes it easier to reject H0 when Ha is true
- Null and alternative hypothesis are further apart
- True proportion is smaller
... why? because more difficult to detect smaller differences with Ho and Ha parameter value
